 To use IFTTT you’ll first need to set up a new account and install their mobile app (if you want to receive phone notifications from your Python app).
 
 
 To see the documentation on how to use the IFTTT webhooks go to <a href="https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks">this page</a> and click on the “Documentation” button in the top right corner. The documentation page contains the webhook URL and it looks like this:

https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/{event}/with/key/{your-IFTTT-key}
Next up, you’ll need to substitute the {event} part with whatever name you gave our event in step 3, when you created the applet. The {your-IFTTT-key} part is already populated with your IFTTT key.
